### Git vs. GitHub
#### Git 
* keeps "snapshots" of your code. ( Instead of making a new file it saves the file ).
* does not require Github.
##### Git Overveiw
* Runs in the command line.
* Basic workflow
  * You have a file ( they are known as a directory ).
    * We initalize git ( this makes your directory into a repository) [repo for short].
  * Edit your file 
  * add your file.
  * commit your file.
 
#### Github
* Stores code in a cloud that can be refered to form any computer.
* Visually tracks changes and logs it so that the user may check to see if undos are nessesary.
* Easily collaborate with other users on files.
* Requires Git
